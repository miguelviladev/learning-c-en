# Welcome to "Learning C"

Even if you are a complete beginner in programming, you can learn C quickly from scratch using this repository. Donâ€™t feel afraid or intimidated, **begin your developer career today**!

I wonâ€™t try to cover everything related to C. Instead, I will focus only on the core concepts of the language while trying to simplify them.

Consider following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/miguel_oviladev) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/miguel_oviladev/) for further insights and updates. Also, you should know that this project was not sponsored by a company, so I only rely on [donations](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/maomv).

Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
