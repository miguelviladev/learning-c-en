# History of C

**C** is a simple and structure oriented programming language created in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at the _Bell Telephone Laboratories_ to develop the UNIX operating system. Because of its features and the spread of the UNIX system, the C programming language quickly became the most used language amongst developers.

Being widely used, many organizations and programmers developed different versions of the language, creating compatibility issues. So in 1983, the _American National Standards Institute_ (ANSI) standardized the language.

Nowadays, it is present in everything: softwares, all operating systems, all major office suites, any hardware (arduino, microcontrollers, industrial machinery), satellites. Being this powerful, other programming languages were derived directly or indirectly from C programming concepts.

In other words: **C runs the world**.
