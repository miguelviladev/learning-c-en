# Reasons to learn C

Currently, we hear almost every day something about a new promising programming language. With newer programming languages available out there, why should we care about a 50-year-old one? But trust me, there are many significant reasons why you should learn C as you are about to find out!

## Popularity

C quickly became the most used language amongst developers. This means that it is well documented in books, tutorials, and forums. So, if you have any question about a specific topic someone probably has already answered it, just do a search.

## Versatility

In what area do we use C? None in particular! C is a general-purpose computer language. That means that it is suitable for the development of almost every project you can imagine: operating systems, kernels, graphical interface software, etc. C is a remarkably powerful and flexible language!

## High level

A [high-level language (HLL)](https://www.toppr.com/guides/computer-aptitude-and-knowledge/basics-of-computers/computer-languages/), such as C, allows the developer to compile programs for different computers and system architectures without making major changes. Also, its syntax is closer to human language, improving readability and making it easier to learn.

## Speed

C can be approximately as fast as Assembly, even though it is a high-level language and uses instructions similar to Python or Pascal. These performance gains are especially noticeable when working with large quantities of data.

## Compatibility

Early in the days developers started creating their own versions of C. That raised compatibility issues.
Thanks to ANSI, who standardized C, code written in a machine can be ported into a different one without having to perform changes.
