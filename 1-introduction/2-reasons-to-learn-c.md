# Reasons to learn C

Currently, we hear almost every day something about a new promising programming language. With newer programming languages available out there, why should we care about a 50-year-old one? But trust me, there are many significant reasons why you should learn C as you are about to find out!

## Popularity

C quickly became the most used language amongst developers. This means that it is well documented in books, tutorials, and forums. So, if you have any question about a specific topic something probably has already answered it. You just need to google it!

## Versatility

In what area do we use C? None in particular! C is a general-purpose computer language. That means that it is suitable for the development of almost every project you can imagine: operating systems, kernels, graphical interface software, etc. C is a remarkably powerful and flexible language!

## High level

A [high-level language (HLL)](https://www.toppr.com/guides/computer-aptitude-and-knowledge/basics-of-computers/computer-languages/), such as C, is a programming language that allows the developer to write programs for many computers and system architectures. Also, its syntax is closer to human language.

## Speed

C can be approximately as fast as Assembly, even though it is a high-level language and uses instructions similar to Python or Pascal. These performance gains are especially noticeable when working with large quantities of data.

## Compatibility

Thanks to ANSI, code written in a machine can be ported into a different one without having to perform any major changes!
