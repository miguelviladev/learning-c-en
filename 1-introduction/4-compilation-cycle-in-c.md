# Compilation cycle in C

As you probably know, a computer only understands 1's and 0's, but when writing C code you use symbols, characters, numbers. Take a look at this code example:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Hello C Language");
    return 0;
}
```

You can tell that this algorithm is written with English words, but our computer is incapable of understanding them. To execute the algorithm we need to convert this source code into binary code. That process is called **compilation**.

The compilation process can be divided into four sub-processes: pre-processing, compiling, assembling, and linking.

### 1. Pre-processing

### 2. Compiling

### 3. Assembling

### 4. Linking
